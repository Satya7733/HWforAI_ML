## üîç Problem Statement

1. **Ask your favorite LLM to identify computational bottlenecks in the FrozenLake code.**
2. **Evaluate the suggestions and assess their relevance and accuracy.**
3. **Request a hardware (HW) implementation for the most critical bottleneck.**
4. **Generate SystemVerilog (SV) code for that HW module.**

## ‚úÖ Key Learnings

### 1. **Identifying Bottlenecks**

Using detailed analysis of the training loop, we found that the **Q-value update equation** is the biggest computational bottleneck:

Q_new = (1 - Œ±) * Q[s, a] + Œ± * (reward + Œ≥ * max(Q[s‚Äô, a‚Äô]))


- **Why it's expensive**: 
  - Executed at every step of every episode
  - Involves multiple multiplications, additions, and max comparisons
  - Requires frequent dictionary (Q-table) access in Python

### 2. **Profiling Support**

We instrumented the code using `time.perf_counter()` to verify that:
- Q-value computation time dominated over action selection and Q-table assignments
- This aligned well with theoretical predictions, validating the LLM's bottleneck detection

### 3. **Hardware Proposal**

A custom **fixed-point Q-value update accelerator** was proposed with:
- Pipelined datapath: max finder, multipliers, adders
- FSM controller with 4 states: `IDLE ‚Üí FIND_MAX ‚Üí COMPUTE ‚Üí DONE`
- Q4.12 fixed-point arithmetic (16-bit) for area-efficient computation on FPGA/ASIC

### 4. **SystemVerilog Implementation**

We generated a **modular RTL design** that includes:
- Input registers for Q-values, reward, Œ±, and Œ≥
- Max finder for computing `max(Q[s‚Äô, a‚Äô])`
- Arithmetic logic for computing Q_new
- Output register with a `done` signal

This SystemVerilog code is suitable for simulation, RTL synthesis, and prototyping on FPGA boards like the Basys 3 or DE0-Nano.
